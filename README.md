VIAaaS
---
Note: this isn't working yet, and I don't know if this will be continued.
Idea: server.example.com._p25565._v1_12_2._otrue.viaaas.example.com (default 25565 port and version default as auto, online-mode can be optional/required) (similar to tor to web proxies)
TODO: What to do with online mode? Create a mod and request to the client to contact Mojang session servers? How would the player make sure the connection to proxy wasn't hijacked? Use host keys like SSH?
